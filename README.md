## Installation
After cloning the repo, users should run:
```bash
npm  i
```
Followed by:
```bash
npm run develop
```
This will start both the client and server to run locally. The client will be available at: http://localhost:3000/ and the server GraphQL playground will be available at: http://localhost:3001/graphql

## Usage
When users open the application, they are presented with the most recent NFTs minted by all users of the application. A user can then log in, and first connect their wallet to then mint a new NFT, once that NFT has been minted, the most recent list of NFTs will be updated to reflect that newly created NFT.

Users can also upload an avatar to their profile and update their tagline. A count of their minted NFTs is also kept.
